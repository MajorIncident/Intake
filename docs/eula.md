# Kepner-Tregoe Intake End User License Agreement

## Scope
- Applies to anyone using the KT Intake web app to capture incident details, generate summaries, or export reports.
- Covers use of bundled templates, summary generators, and any future add-ons shipped with this site.
- Assumes the app runs in your browser; your organization is responsible for meeting its own compliance requirements.

## Data usage
- Information you enter is stored locally in your browser (localStorage key `kt-intake-full-v2`) until you clear it or export it.
- Downloads you trigger (such as Save/Load files) stay on your device unless you choose to share them.
- If you connect the app to external services (e.g., via custom deployments), you are responsible for notifying users and following their terms.

## Restrictions
- Do not use the app to store or transmit regulated, confidential, or legally protected data unless your environment is approved for it.
- Do not reverse engineer, redistribute, or package the app for resale without written permission from Kepner-Tregoe.
- Use the app in ways that respect privacy laws and organizational policies; disable integrations if you cannot ensure compliance.

## Export
- You may export summaries, checklists, and supporting notes for incident documentation and communication.
- Exports are provided "as is"; you must review and validate accuracy before acting on them.
- Removing your local data (clearing storage or deleting files) does not affect copies you have already shared externally.
