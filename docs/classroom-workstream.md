# Classroom Experience Workstream Status

This is the live restart document for the Classroom Experience program (#288).

**Rule:** update this file in every classroom-related PR before handoff. It should answer “where are we, what is safe, and what should a cold AI do next?” without requiring chat history.

## Current phase

Architecture and governance bootstrap.

## Program issues

| Slice | Issue | Status | PR / branch | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program | #288 | Open | — | Parent architecture/roadmap |
| Experience role | #289 | Not started | — | First runtime slice |
| Templates / Case Studies | #290 | Not started | — | Can stack on #289 |
| Class domain/API | #291 | Not started | — | Can branch from #289 in parallel with #290 |
| Student join/resume | #292 | Not started | — | Depends on #291 |
| Instructor observer | #293 | Not started | — | Depends on class semantics |
| Coaching | #294 | Not started | — | Depends on observer |
| Protected cases | #295 | Not started | — | Requires #290 + #291 |
| Browser E2E/CI | #296 | Not started | — | Uses #279 infrastructure |
| Browser test foundation | #279 | Existing open issue | — | Shared Playwright/accessibility foundation |

## Current architecture decisions

- Experience role, intake mode, and resource kind are separate axes.
- Standalone remains the backwards-compatible local-first product.
- Student/team workspaces reuse existing collaboration snapshot/revision/presence behavior.
- Instructor observes student Intake read-only.
- Coaching is a separate persistence/revision channel.
- Classroom credentials never belong in exported Intake state.
- Case Study password is instructional gating, not authentication.
- Protected Case Study payloads ultimately move out of the public client bundle.

See `docs/classroom-architecture.md` for the full contract.

## Cold restart checklist

1. Inspect current `main` HEAD and all open PRs/issues matching #288–#296 and #279.
2. Read:
   - root `AGENTS.md`;
   - `docs/classroom-architecture.md`;
   - `docs/classroom-roadmap.md`;
   - this file;
   - `docs/AI-ONBOARDING.md`;
   - `docs/REPOSITORY-OPERATIONS.md`.
3. Identify the earliest incomplete slice whose dependencies are satisfied.
4. If an implementation PR is already open, continue that PR rather than creating competing work.
5. Refresh the branch from its documented base before editing.
6. Run/inspect `npm run quality`.
7. Before handoff, update this table, record validation, and write the exact next action below.

## Active work

Architecture/governance bootstrap branch only.

## Last completed action

Created #288–#296 and established the durable architecture/roadmap/workstream documentation.

## Next recommended action

After the architecture/governance PR is reviewed/merged, start #289 on a short-lived branch from current `main`. Implement only the experience-role foundation and entry/resume layer; do not begin class persistence in that PR.

## Known risks / watch items

- Existing Case Study payloads are client-bundled; role-based hiding is not a confidentiality control.
- Existing collaboration secret links grant equal edit access and have no administrator role; classroom authorization must layer over rather than silently reinterpret those links.
- There is deliberately no current workspace-list endpoint; student non-enumeration must remain a security property when instructor listing is added.
- Classroom role/session state must not leak into `kt-intake-full-v2`.
- Instructor read-only behavior must be server-enforced, not just disabled controls.
